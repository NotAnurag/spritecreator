Sprite creator tool that allows you to draw simple pixel art in the browser and download it to your computer. I made this to get better at working with JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

Made using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the html2canvas library.

Things I would add/change in the future:

1. Drawing by dragging the mouse is very unreliable. I don't know how much of it is due to my own mouse or the code itself, but it is probably both.

2. Add a feature that randomly generates images to use as reference art while drawing.

3. A better color selection system with more variety in shades.

4. A way to change the dimensions/pixel size of the board, either through a slider tool or by entering specific dimensions into a text box.

5. General improvements to the design/style
